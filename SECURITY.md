   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours

# Lint for security issues
npm run security-lint
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] Authorization escalation tests
- [ ] Input validation testing
- [ ] XSS vulnerability testing
- [ ] CSRF protection verification
- [ ] Rate limiting validation
- [ ] Session management testing

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server
3. **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
4. **Implement proper error handling** to avoid information disclosure
5. **Follow principle of least privilege** for access control
6. **Keep dependencies updated** and audit regularly

### For Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
2. **Configure security headers** properly
3. **Monitor and log** security events
4. **Regular security updates** and patches
5. **Backup and recovery** procedures
6. **Network security** configurations
